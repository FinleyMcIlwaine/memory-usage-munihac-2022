# Memory Usage Profiling With `eventlog2html` and `ghc-debug`

## Abstract

Understanding and analyzing the memory usage of Haskell programs is a
notoriously difficult yet important problem. Recent improvements to GHC's
profiling capabilities, along with better tooling, has made it much easier to
deeply and precisely analyze the memory usage characteristics of even large
Haskell programs.

This workshop aims to present two such tools that allow high and low level
memory usage analysis of Haskell programs: `eventlog2html` and `ghc-debug`. We
will learn how to set up and use `eventlog2html` to generate high-level visuals
and statistics of our program's execution. We will also learn how to set up and
use `ghc-debug` to precisely and programmatically explore our program's
low-level memory usage profile.

We will examine these tools by using them on several pre-prepared Haskell
programs. The workshop aims to be beneficial to Haskell programmers of all
levels. Beginner Haskell programmers can expect to gain a deeper understanding
of lazy evaluation and the impacts it can have on program performance.
Experienced Haskell programmers can expect to gain an understanding of exactly
what these tools have to offer and the skills necessary to use these tools on
their own Haskell programs.
